  <h3>WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD!</h3>

      <h4>My Main Theory about Reloaded and Revolutions:<a name="main"></a></h4>
  </li>

  <p>The movies Reloaded and Revolutions
        take place between the kiss of Neo and Trinity, and Neo's last phone
    call at the end of the Matrix. So the trilogy ends with Neo making his phone
    call<br>
  <br>
  The original Matrix starts with Trinity and Cypher talking, the screen
shows "Trace
      Program" and the date "2-19-98".<br>
  <br>
  The movie ends with Neo making a phone call, the trace program is initiated
and the date reads "9-18-99"... 19 months have passed at this point (One
      year and seven months).<br>
  <br>
  The time sequence in the first movie implies that they found Neo shortly after
  that initial conversation (a few months after 2-19-98 at most).<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The Proof<br>
  Only a few months could have passed from the time Morpheus and the crew 'free'
  Neo to the time Neo is killed and revived in the hallway. Why? For one, Neo's
  hair barely grows in that time and that's not a trivial observation. It's also
  obvious that Neo grew out his hair in Reloaded which occurs roughly 6 months
  after he's unplugged.<br>
  <br>
  We also know the Wachowski brothers don't put insignificant things into their
  movies. The fact that they obviously signal to us that 19 months have passed
  from the start of the Matrix to the time Neo makes that phone call is there
  for a reason.<br>
  <br>
  In Reloaded, Neo says that "I wish I knew what I was supposed to do". The phone
      call scene in The Matrix, Neo is very sure of what he is supposed to do, "I'm
      going to hang up this phone and show these people what you don't want them
      to see... a world without you, without controls and boundries". Why would
      he have forgotten what to do between the first and second movie? He didn't,
      that last scene in The Matrix occurs after Revolutions!<br>
  <br>
  Also, at the end of the first movie, Neo states that "I can feel you now, you
      are scared". At the end of Reloaded he says, "Something is different, I
      can FEEL them now". </p>

    </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li> The Oracle is giving neo a red candy which is probably her hidden reference
	        to Morpheus' red pill in Matrix&nbsp;1.<br>
    <i> Oracle: "You [Neo] didn't
            come here to make the choice, you've already made it. You're here to
            try <b> to understand why </b> you
       made it..."<br>
    Neo: "<b>Why </b> are you here?"<br>
    Oracle: "<b>Same </b> reason. I love candy."</i><br>
    A similar conversation in Matrix&nbsp;1:<br>
    <i>Morpheus: "You take the <b> red pill</b>...and I show
    you how deep the rabbit hole goes...I'm offering you...<b>the truth</b>"</i><br>
    Well, the truth in Matrix&nbsp;1 was, that there is another level of
      life (= Zion). Maybe this time, too.</li>
  <li> Neo gets a battered-looking silver spoon from an orphan <b>in Zion</b>.<br>
    This spoon looks as if the orphan (from <span style="font-variant: small-caps;"> Matrix&nbsp;1</span>)
      has bent it like <b>within the Matrix</b>.<br>
    Please also note, that in <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Matrix&nbsp;1</span> an
      orphan (=spoon boy) who shows Neo the spoon is doing so right before Neo
      goes to the Oracle. The same happens in <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Matrix&nbsp;2</span>:
      Just before Neo wants to leave Zion to meet the Oracle the spoon is given
      to him.</li>
  <li>  There are a few scenes where Trinity talks onboard Morpheus' ship
    and Neo seems to react in the Matrix as if he could hear that:  
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <ul>
    <li>After Neo dies (Matrix&nbsp;1)
              Trinity talks to him <b>in Zion</b> and he rises from the dead <b>in
      the Matrix</b>.</li>
    <li>After he rises in the Matrix Trinity shouts "Neo!" and
      he reacts instantly and runs to the phone.</li>
    <li>When Neo is covered all over by the agents Trinity says...<br>
        Trinity: "Come on, get out of there."<br>
    ...and Neo flies away.</li>
  </ul>
  </ol>
