<p>Here are some of Ankur's favorite quotes:</p>

<ol>

<li>
	"It's him.<br>
	<i>The Anomaly.</i><br>
	Do we proceed?<br>
	<i>Yes.</i><br>
	He is still...<br>
	<i>...only human.</i>"
</li>

<br>
<br>

<li>
	"bortaS bIr jablu’DI’ reH QaQqu’ nay’"
</li>

<br>
<br>

<li>
	"A women shoulders are the front lines of her mystique. And her neck, if she's alive, 
	is all the mystery of a border town. A no mans land in that battle between the mind and the body."
</li>

<br>
<br>

<li>
	"Let me give you a little inside information about God.<br>
	God likes to watch. He's a prankster. Think about it.<br>
	He gives man INSTINCTS! He gives you this extraordinary gift, and then what does He do, 
	I swear for His own amusement, his own private, cosmic gag reel, He sets the rules in opposition.<br>
	It's the goof of all time.<br>
	Look but don't touch.<br>
	Touch, but don't taste!<br>
	Taste, don't swallow.<br>
	Ahaha! And when you're jumpin' from one foot to the next, what is he doing?<br>
	He's laughin' His sick, ******* ass off.<br>
	He's a tight-ass! He's a sadist!<br>
	He's an absentee landlord. Worship THAT? <b>NEVER!</b>"
